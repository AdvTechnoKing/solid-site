The SolidJS Core and Ecosystem Teams are excited to announce the launch of a new important program to help push SolidJS development forward. 2022 has been an exceptional year for the framework's growth. The adoption path for small and large projects and companies is an important aspect of our team’s focus. Instilling a sense of dependability, stability and progress is central to our efforts.

With Solid now a year into its v1.0 release and with the imminent release of SolidStart, the Core Team is busier than ever laying the foundations for further radical growth. Given the effort and small footprint of our team we’ve decided to deploy our current OpenCollective funds in a manner that maximizes the funds entrusted to us by our community.

For this reason we are glad to announce Solid Fellowships, an initiative by which non-core community members will be given fixed-term opportunities to work on Core directed projects. Projects will range from research, bug triage & fixing, writing documentation and general community support tasks.

# Introducing the Inaugural Cohort

We are also pleased to announce that the first Fellowship cohort will be a 5 month engagement with 2 Fellows. Each fellow will receive compensation of US$1000/month. We’re pleased to present our two inaugural members:

## Alexis H. Munsayac ([lxsmnsyc](https://www.github.com/lxsmnsyc))

Alexis is a software engineer based in the Philippines who has been a long-time member of the SolidJS community. His work has helped improve the future of reactivity and web development in general. His contributions have included supporting Solid Refresh and DOM Expressions, as well as building libraries to help expand the SolidJS ecosystem. During the tenure of his fellowship, Alexis will support SolidStart release efforts. Having developed Rigidity, Waystone and similar meta-framework tooling he is an ideal candidate to support Core in bringing Start to production readiness.

## Damian Tarnawski ([thetarnav](https://www.github.com/thetarnav))

Damian is a web developer who was born and lives in Poland. Technology, reactivity and architecting original ideas as open-source projects have always been amongst his great passions. He has been an active contributor to Solid Primitives and is currently focused on Solid Developer Tools, a suite of utilities designed for making working with the frame easier. During the tenure of his fellowship, Damian will focus on Developer Tools and supporting integration with SolidStart to ensure that the DX story between tooling is of the highest quality possible.

# Open Fellowship Opportunity

We are also pleased to announce that we are opening the third position up to public applications. Our third Fellowship position will be focused specifically on documentation writing. With Solid API and SolidStart API documentation rewrites in the works our team would like to supercharge the effort with focused talent.

We're seeking a Fellowship member excited about educating users and writing beautiful, clear and concise documentation. We will make a selection based on prior docs and Solid experience. Solid is also committed to providing equal opportunities for all. We welcome individuals from all walks of life and perspectives.

The position will provide US$1000/month and be awarded to an individual selected by Core and Ecosystem members. The decision will be based on a number of factors including but not limited to: experience, availability, technical writing abilities etc.

# Budget and Awarding Fellowships

The Fellowship program will launch with a meager budget with the intention of growing it with further personal and corporate sponsors. If your corporation is interested in using Solid, now's your moment to support Solid’s adoption story and help it produce a highly durable framework for use by your organization. Feel free to donate directly to our OpenCollective or contact community@solidjs.com for more information and guidance.

Solid Fellows are granted to close community members that are actively involved in furthering Solid’s goals. The Core team will continue selecting future cohort members based on general interest and availability of talented contributors willing to focus on Solid efforts. If you have an idea or interest in being involved, reach out to our team members to start the conversation!

Thank you to everyone, especially our OpenColletive sponsors for making this possible. Solid as a project remains committed to being progressive and pushing boundaries, we hope that Fellowships become a successful program that fosters strong community bonds, friendships and bright futures.
